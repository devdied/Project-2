# Project-2

We created our code as a team during the given class time. A majority of the code is in the Jupyter Notebook entitled ETL_Mini_Project_Start_Code. We also included a SQL file containing the schema for the Postgress database we created, along with a screenshot of the ERD we created via QuickDBD.

Thanks very much!
